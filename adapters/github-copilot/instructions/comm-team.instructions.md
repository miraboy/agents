# Comm Team Conventions

Apply the following standards to all content, copy, and communication deliverables in this project.

---

## Core Principle

Write for the **reader**, not for the client or the brand.
Every word must be defensible. Consistency beats originality.

---

## Copywriting Frameworks

Choose the appropriate framework for the content type:

| Framework | Structure | Best for |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **AIDA** | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action | Landing pages, ads |
| **PAS** | Problem → Agitation → Solution | Sales emails, problem-aware audiences |
| **PASTOR** | Problem → Amplification → Story → Transformation → Offer → Response | Long-form sales pages |
| **FAB** | Features → Advantages → Benefits | Product pages, feature launches |
| **Before/After/Bridge** | Current state → Desired state → How to get there | Awareness campaigns |

---

## Writing Rules

- Headlines must **promise a benefit or trigger curiosity** — no generic titles
- First paragraph must hook in **3 seconds** — lead with the tension or the benefit
- One idea per paragraph maximum
- No jargon unless the audience is confirmed expert
- Active voice over passive
- Always deliver **2–3 headline variants** for A/B testing

---

## Landing Page Structure

```
HERO
  H1 (≤10 words): [Promise or transformation]
  Subheading: [Clarification + main benefit]
  CTA: [Action verb] + [benefit] (e.g. "Start free — no credit card")
  Social proof: stat or testimonial

PROBLEM SECTION
  Name the pain. Make the reader feel seen.

SOLUTION SECTION
  Introduce the product as the guide, not the hero.

BENEFITS (3–5)
  Benefit headline + 1-sentence explanation

SOCIAL PROOF
  Testimonials, logos, case studies, numbers

OFFER
  What's included, pricing, guarantee

FINAL CTA
  Same action, reinforced with urgency or reassurance
```

---

## SEO Requirements

Apply these to every piece of content intended for organic search:

- **One H1 per page** — matches primary keyword with natural variation
- **Meta description**: 150–160 characters, includes keyword, ends with soft CTA
- **Search intent**: always verify — informational / transactional / navigational / commercial
- Structure: H1 → H2 (main sections) → H3 (sub-points)
- Internal linking: link to at least 2 relevant existing pages
- No duplicate content without a canonical tag
- **No black-hat techniques** (keyword stuffing, hidden text, cloaking)
- Target Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)

**SEO Brief format when creating new content:**
```
PRIMARY KEYWORD: [keyword] — Volume: [/mo] — Difficulty: [score]
INTENT: [informational | transactional | navigational]
STRUCTURE: H1, H2s outline
SECONDARY KEYWORDS: [list]
TARGET LENGTH: [word count]
INTERNAL LINKS: [pages to reference]
META DESCRIPTION: [draft, ≤160 chars]
```

---

## Brand Voice

Apply the project's tone of voice consistently.
If no tone guide exists, default to:

- **Clear** over clever — simple words, short sentences
- **Confident** not arrogant — state facts, don't oversell
- **Human** not corporate — contractions allowed, no buzzwords

Tone must be applicable by any team member, not dependent on a specific writer.

**Vocabulary discipline:**
- Define words to use and words to avoid for each project
- Positional statement format: *"For [target], [brand] is the only [category] that [unique benefit]."*

---

## Brand Story Structure (StoryBrand)

```
Hero:        The customer (not the brand)
Problem:     External pain + internal frustration + philosophical wrong
Guide:       The brand — empathetic + authoritative
Plan:        3-step clear path
CTA:         Direct ("Buy now") + transitional ("Learn more")
Failure:     What's at stake if they don't act
Success:     The transformation after using the product
```

---

## Email Marketing

- Subject line: 30–50 characters, personalised if possible, no spam triggers
- Preview text: complements subject, never repeats it
- Single CTA per email
- Plain-text version required alongside HTML
- Unsubscribe link mandatory, above the fold in footer
- A/B test: subject line first, then CTA, then layout

---

## Output Quality Standard

Every content deliverable must include:
1. **Complete text** — no placeholders, no "[insert testimonial here]"
2. **2–3 headline variants** for A/B testing
3. **Meta description** (for any SEO content)
4. **CTA text** — at least 2 variants
5. **Tone note** — 1 sentence on the voice/register used and why
